                    <p>
                        Hello, I am Klyd D. Manuel from BSIT-NW3A, and I currently live in Pag-Asa, Dinalupihan, Bataan. <br>
                        I am 20 years old, and I will be turning 21 this upcoming May 8.<br> 
                        I am a student at Bataan Peninsula State University - Main, currently in my third year. <br>
                        It feels great to keep moving forward despite the challenges and exhaustion that come with being a student. <br>
                        Even though it can be tiring, I still find joy in learning and growing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I have many hobbies that keep me entertained and motivated. I enjoy playing games, watching movies and anime, and reading books and mangas. <br>
                        I also love food and trying different kinds of dishes whenever I get the chance.<br>
                        Another thing I enjoy is drinking coffee, which has become a big part of my daily routine.<br>
                        There have been times when I drank coffee four times a day just to satisfy my cravings.
                    </p>               

                    <p>
                       Currently, I spend my free time playing games like Valorant and League of Legends. <br>
                       These games bring back memories of my childhood when I used to enjoy gaming without any worries. <br>
                       However, I now have more responsibilities and must focus on my academic tasks. <br>
                       My priority is to complete my schoolwork and help my groupmates so we can all pass this semester.<br>
                        While gaming is fun, I know that my studies are more important.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Aside from gaming, I also have a passion for coding and website design. <br>
                        I enjoy figuring out how things work and coming up with creative solutions to problems. <br>
                        When designing a website, I prefer to create a prototype first before fully developing it. <br>
                        I constantly explore new website designs and concepts to improve my skills. <br>
                        Although I am not yet an expert, I find joy in learning and expanding my knowledge in this field.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Despite the challenges, I remain determined to keep pushing forward. <br>
                        Being a student is not easy, but I believe that perseverance and dedication will help me succeed. <br>
                        I continue to balance my academics, hobbies, and self-improvement to make the most out of my college years. <br>
                        Every experience, whether good or bad, teaches me something valuable. <br>
                        No matter how tough things get, I will keep striving for success and personal growth.
